Feeling Bold?
To make text bold, surround it with double asterisks. So this code:

Isn't today a **wonderful** day?
becomes: Isn't today a wonderful day?

Italics, I tell you!
To italicize text, surround it with underscores. So this code:

And in that moment I thought to myself: _Did I turn off the stove?_
becomes: And in that moment I thought to myself: Did I turn off the stove?

To code, or not to code?
Inline code is useful for indicating that you're writing code and not a regular word. For this, you'll surround text in backticks (`, not a single quote). So this code:

You should use the `strong` tag.
becomes: You should use the strong tag.

The Title Sequence
Headings are even simpler! For h1 through h6 tags, all you'll need is a # before your text. The number of #s you include tells Markdown which header tag you're using. For example:

## This is an h2.

### This is an h3.

becomes...

This is an h2.
This is an h3.

Working with .md Files
Much like how your HTML files should be saved with a .html extension, your Markdown files should be saved with a .md extension.
